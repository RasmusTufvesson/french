# French
This is a small program i made to have some fun and improve my french. You can search through different french words or sentences and filter for specific categories of words. The program also shows you some information about the words/sentences and translations in both english and swedish when you hover over them. The program does not come with a word or sentence list so you have to input them yourself. There is also a verbs tab that you can look up the different forms of words in.

## Todo

* Make words you know not appear multiple times in practice
* Add more types of adjectives, eg numerical adjectives
* Make default adjectives have 4 forms (male and female plural)
